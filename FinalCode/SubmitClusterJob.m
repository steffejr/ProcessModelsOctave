function [JobName, ClusterCommand] = SubmitClusterJob(jobPath,JobOutputFolder,WaitList)
% This is the function that makes the qsub call for submitting a job to the
% cluster.
% Return the job name so it can be used with a wait command for executing
% cluster jobs that require other jobs to finish first.
% 
% This function needs some optimization. Specifically, I need to learn more
% about the memory management and use of the queues. It would be nice t
% estimate the memory requirements of the jobs based o n the data size and
% the number of jobs the analysis is split into. Such an approach would
% optimize the cluster use.
