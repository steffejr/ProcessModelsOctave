% The first model is a basic mediation model testing whether the effect of age

% The modeling is specified using a series of matrices. The first is the
% DIRECT matrix. This matrix is square with dimension based onthe number of
% variables in the model. The rows and columns refer to the variabvles in
% the model in the same order as they are specified in the data matrix.
% Since the path analyses are in fact a series of regression models these
% models get specified in DIRECT matrix. Interaction or moderating effects
% get specified in the INTER(actions) matrix below.

% A simple mediation model would be: 
% VAR_2 = VAR_1
% VAR_3 = VAR_1 + VAR_2

% DIRECT matrix the main effects for each of these variables on the
% predicted variable.

% For this model there are no interactions so this is kept as a zero
% matrix.
